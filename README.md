## Description
Implementation of a blockchain data-structure that uses a REST API to mine, send, and receive transactions on the network.  Nodes use the longest valid chain as the consensus protocol.  Added wallet identities for participants of the blockchain to send/receive data transactions.  Created a page using flask to post transactions from a given node.
